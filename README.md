## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Files

### 1. **Jupyter Notebooks**
   - You can open `.ipynb` files using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Each file contains detailed explanations with practical examples that you can run directly.
   - You can modify the code and experiment with it to better understand the concepts.

### 2. **PDF Files**
   - The PDF files contain theoretical explanations for each part of the course.
   - You can use them as a quick reference or to review the concepts.
   - You can download and read them on any device that supports PDF files.

## üìã Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebooks smoothly, you need the following environment:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**: You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install notebook jupyterlab
